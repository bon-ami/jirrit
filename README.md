## Config xml

  As shown in example.xml, root name is **jirrit**.<BR>
  **log** file name can be configured.<BR>
  Server types are **JIRA** and **Gerrit**.<BR>
  Names need to be unique within each type.<BR>
  **url** is needed for every server. **pass** can be provided, if not same as overall config.
  **ip** is optional for a server for refernce only.

  Three kinds of passwords can be configured.
  - **basic** is the plain text password.
  - **plain** is coded text password. Tools such as Postman can show this in the output message.
  - **digest** is generated by a server.

  For Jira servers, there may be more to config for issue closure with some fields filled.<BR>
  - **project** is the previous X part of an ID X-0, used. This is maintained by the program.
Usually, these fields can be seen in an issue's detail.
  - **rejectrsn** is the field name for reject reasons.
  - **testpre** is the field name for test condition.
  - **teststep** is the field name for test steps.
  - **testexp** is the field name for test expectation.
  - **state** are state names. Supported attributes: **not open**.

  For Gerrit servers, there may be more to config for scores.
  - **score** contains the field name other than Code-Review and Verified, that needs +1. In my case, it is `Manual-Testing`.

## Input grammar

 - For most prompts, [Enter] without default value as shown is taken as an invalid input and return to previous menu.
 - If previous value is in the format of ".+\-[0-9]+", or X-0, to be easier to read, and the new input is just a number, it will be taken as the number replacing the previous number part.
 - In some cases, input support multiple lines. End an input with "\" to indicate it is a line of multiple ones and continue inputting.
 - In some cases,<BR>
Input ".+\-[0-9]+[,][,][0-9]+", or "X-0,,1", or "0,,1", to be easier to read, to batch process all the ID's between, and including, the two numbers.<BR>
Input "X-0,Y-1,2", to be easier to read, to batch process all the ID's listed, adding previous letter part. ("X-0,Y-1,2" will result in processing X-0, Y-1 and Y-2.)<BR>
Supported for: reject and closure in Jira; rebase, merge and abandon in Gerrit.
